Day 10:
    Loop, so replace S with right pipe
    Start from the right and go until you find the first pipe.

    Mark any open space on the other side of the inside wall as inside.

    Use three dimensional array dp[grid index][run lengths index][starting/finishing]

Day 17:
    Is it possible to add a filtering function around neighbors for the ulimate
    crucible instead of making an entirely differnt function?  This would
    help with the "hacky" addition of if statement to prevent stopping on the

    Model the neighbors as turn or go forward min steps to max steps instead
    of just a single step forward counting consecutive blocks
